# Disclaimer:
This mod is for the game [**Vampire Survivors**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) and requires [MelonLoader 6.1](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases) to use.

## MoveSpeed Cap+

Adds a configurable minimum, maximum, and added (or subtracted) bonus to the movement speed for all characters, and a setting in game to disable/enable the mod.

### Installation:
- Install MelonLoader and run the game once.

- Go to your game's directory and paste the `.dll` into your `Mods` folder.

You have now installed **Move Speed Cap+!**

## Config

You can find the config in the game's directory under: 
- `Configs`

  - `Farukon's Mods`

    - `MoveSpeedPlusConfig.json`
    
### Config Values:

The Config has descriptions for the values inside and they go as such:

- `Enabled` **(Don't worry about changing this one in the file, there's a button in the gameplay setting)**

- `MoveSpeedAdd`

  - "Increases or decreases the movement speed of all characters by a set amount. E.g. 0.11 adds 11% to your movespeed."
  
  - Default = `0.0`
  
- `MinMoveSpeed`

  - "The minimum your movement speed can be. E.g. -0.55 means you'll always have more than -155% movement speed ingame."
  
  - Default = `-1.0`
  
- `MaxMoveSpeed`

  - "The maximum your movement speed can be. E.g. 1.58 you'll never have more than +58% movement speed ingame."
  
  - Default = `3.0`
  
### Move-Speed Note:  
  
**Base Move-Speed is `1.0`, or `-` in game.**
